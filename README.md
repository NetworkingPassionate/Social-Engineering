# Social-Engineering
( <br> )

📊 Social engineering is behind a staggering percentage of cyber breaches — depending on how it's defined, estimates range from 60% to 90%.
Here’s a breakdown of key stats from recent 2025 reports:
- 60% of data breaches involve social engineering as a primary vector
- 98% of cyberattacks rely on some form of social engineering tactic
- 91% of cyberattacks begin with a phishing email — a classic social engineering method
- Over 80% of data breaches involve human error, often triggered by social engineering
💡 These numbers highlight that human behavior is often the weakest link in cybersecurity — not the tech itself. That’s why awareness training, phishing simulations, and behavioral analytics are now considered essential layers of defense.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Engineering Practices – Staff Awareness Guide

Welcome to the team! As stewards of sensitive data, it's our collective responsibility to uphold the highest standards in cybersecurity. This document outlines **essential engineering practices** that every staff member—technical or non-technical—should understand and follow to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 🔑 Core Principles

- **Confidentiality**: Limit access to sensitive data on a strict need-to-know basis.
- **Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate, unaltered, and protected from unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability**: Keep systems and data reliably accessible to authorized users.

### 🧠 Staff Responsibilities

#### 🔐 1. Access Control & Authentication
- Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where supported
- Report orphaned or unused accounts for deactivation

#### 🚫 2. Secure Device & Endpoint Usage
- Lock devices when unattended
- Avoid plugging unknown USB devices into work machines
- Run approved antivirus and endpoint protection tools

#### 🧼 3. Data Handling Hygiene
- Only store sensitive data in encrypted locations
- Avoid sending confidential files over unverified email or chat platforms
- Label data correctly (e.g., "Internal Use Only", "Confidential")

#### 🧪 4. Awareness of Social Engineering
- Never share credentials via phone, email, or messaging apps
- Be wary of unsolicited requests, even if they appear legitimate
- Report suspicious emails, messages, or calls immediately

#### 🛠 5. Software & Patch Management
- Keep your systems and applications updated
- Reboot regularly after updates are applied
- Do not install unverified third-party apps or browser extensions

#### 🔍 6. Logging & Incident Reporting
- Know what types of activity are monitored (e.g., login attempts, downloads)
- Immediately report any unusual system behavior or suspected breaches
- Use the provided incident report template for quick documentation

### 🛡️ Engineering-Led Safeguards

These are built into our infrastructure and maintained by IT & SecOps teams—but staff play a critical role in their effectiveness:

- **Firewall rules**: Restrict external access based on IP and protocol
- **SIEM monitoring**: Detect anomalies in system logs and trigger alerts
- **Vulnerability scans**: Identify and remediate security gaps
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit and at rest using approved standards

### ✅ Final Reminder

Every staff member is a critical part of the organization’s security posture. These practices are not suggestions—they’re safeguards protecting both our clients and our mission. Stay vigilant, stay secure.
